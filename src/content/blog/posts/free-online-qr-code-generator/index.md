What a shame -- nowadays, one quick request to GPT spits out a proper HTML page
with a full-fledged QR code generator...[^1] and yet I wasted _way_ more time
Googling for a free generator that could give me `png` and `svg`. Every single
one wants registration, logging in through some OAuth nonsense, or worst of all,
a payment just for an `svg` 🤦🏼.

Just because of that, I made my own.

So, here’s an _actually_ free QR code generator. No sign-ups, no fees, just
works. I’m only tracking pageviews, so chill.

(And yep, I gotta throw in some text here to make search engines happy 🙃)

[^1]:
    Actually digging into it with `.svg`, it takes more time, current GPT didn't
    know actual versions, and actual versions has a bugs, so I have to fork it.
