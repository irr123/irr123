Here's a tool to peek at your PlayStation life-hours played, games beaten,
 the works. It's open-source, so feel free to mess with it and add your own spin.

## My stats

A third of a year lost (or gained?) to gaming! This doesn't even include my
 Steam hours, I'm almost afraid to add those up ðŸ™ˆ


## Conclusion

It's a neat way to see where your time's gone. Give it a try, at least you'll
 find unplayed or forgotten games in your library ðŸŽ®
