Have you _truly_ considered the catastrophic risks of losing all your
 [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) data?
 Can your business afford such a loss?

Let me guide you in mitigating those risks. I asked myself the same question
 and searched for a reliable, out-of-the-box solution. Disappointed with
 Google's suggestions, I decided to build my own. Think of it as playing with
 Lego-assembling the necessary components.

## What building blocks do we need?

- Access to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
- [rclone](https://rclone.org): A powerful tool that provides rsync-like CLI
  functionality for managing filesystems and cloud storage. It's
  well-documented, but we'll focus on a streamlined approach

### Google Cloud Console: Setting Up the Service Account

We'll start with the most crucial step: obtaining the necessary credentials to
 interact with the Google API. (Remember to enable the
 [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)
 if you haven't already) This involves creating a
 [Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
 and generating a [JSON private key](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account).

Here's an example of what it looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<project name>",
  "private_key_id": "<hash>",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<some base64 encoded stuff>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "<service account name>@<project name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<another one id>",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/<service account name>%40<project name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

### rclone: Configuring and Executing the Backup

We're almost there! The next step is to set up rclone for automated execution
 using [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) on a host of your choice.
 I'll skip the details of acquiring a hosting environment.

Here's prepared `rclone.conf`:

```toml
[google-drive]
type = drive
service_account_file = /config/rclone/sa.json  # <- The key
```

And here's how to use it with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/):

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -v ./config:/config/rclone \
    -v ./data:/data \
    rclone/rclone --drive-shared-with-me \
    copy google-drive:<SHARED FOLDER> /data/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
```

### rclone: Recovering the Backup

To restore your backup, simply reverse the source and destination paths in the
 rclone copy command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -v ./config:/config/rclone \
    -v ./data:/data \
    rclone/rclone --drive-shared-with-me \
    copy /data/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d") google-drive:<SHARED FOLDER>
```

Be aware that if you recover data, the original permissions will be lost,
 and the _Service Account_ will become the owner of all recovered data.

#### Important Note

A _Service Account_ is essentially an account with its own folder and
 permissions within Google Drive. Therefore, you must share the desired
 folders with it. The `<SHARED FOLDER>` in the bash command refers to
 the exact name of the shared folder.

## Conclusion

This provides a solid foundation for Google Drive backup. To enhance its
 enterprise-level security and reliability, consider implementing additional
 [encryption](https://rclone.org/crypt/) and robust, cost-effective
 [storage](https://rclone.org/s3/) solutions.

Stay tuned, we're gonna talk about that [next]({{< relref "posts/google-drive-backup-part2" >}}).
