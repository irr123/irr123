I'm Ivan Bogomolov, a software engineer. I still enjoy working with
[technology]({{< relref "uses" >}}), and this blog is where that interest ends
up.

Most of my work lives between architecture and operations: choosing simple
designs, knowing when _not_ to add microservices, and fixing systems that
already exist. Coding is still the best part; I make room for it here.

[Here]({{< relref "blog" >}}) I write about self-hosting, networking, AI, and
trade-offs discovered the hard way.

I prefer simplicity and pragmatism over hype and marketing. Boring, on purpose.

If you have a concrete technical problem or system to untangle, email works
best.
