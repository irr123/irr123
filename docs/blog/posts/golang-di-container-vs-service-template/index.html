    <h1>DI Container vs. Service Template (generator)</h1>

    

    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about building and evolving <a href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a> services in
the enterprise. We&rsquo;ll explore two approaches:</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The challenge is a timeless one: accelerating the delivery of value to
production. From a technical perspective, this translates to several key
requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-built components:</strong>  These eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel,
saving valuable development time.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent service structure:</strong>  A uniform structure reduces
context-switching overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Unified interaction interfaces:</strong> Standardized configuration, logging, and
metrics save significant time for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">operations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Imagine a company with a few internal services looking to expand and release
more. Or consider an outsourcing company developing services for external
clients and aiming to increase its customer base. In both scenarios,
efficiency is paramount, and directly related to the problems highlighted earlier.</p>
<p>When examining individual services, we often find that, regardless of the
specific <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html">layered architecture</a>
employed (e.g., <a href="https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">Onion</a>,
<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean</a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)">Hexagonal</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>)
outer layers tend to be shared across services, whereas the core business
logic remains distinct<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Specifically, elements such as observability tools,
database connections, and message broker clients can be identical. These
constitute the essential pre-built components and contribute to a consistent
service structure. A unified interaction interface emerges from the
standardized configuration of these pre-built components. For example, a
shared database connection operates with consistent configuration parameters,
providing uniform logging, metrics, and deployment procedures.</p>
<h4 id="straightforward-implementation">Straightforward implementation</h4>
<p>A common approach is to consolidate all shared code into one or more shared
libraries. A service template can then be created to generate new services
that include these libraries as dependencies, along with pre-prepared
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>While addressing initial setup challenges, this method introduces a new
problem: a continuously evolving template will inevitably diverge from the
services it generates.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;templating&rdquo; nature of this approach makes the template itself difficult
to test and analyze with static analysis tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="di-container-to-the-rescue"><a href="https://github.com/irr123/di">DI container</a> to the Rescue</h4>
<p>Instead of relying on templates, we can retain the shared library approach and
encapsulate all pre-built components within a container. This allows
developers to focus solely on adding the business logic, adhering to the
chosen layered architecture:</p>

<p>This approach reduces maintenance costs because it involves well-typed,
valid code (without templating complexities) that can be effectively covered
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_management#Software_quality_and_the_software_lifecycle">quality checks</a>.
Furthermore, backward compatibility is maintained by following standard coding practices.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-uncovered-parts">Finishing Uncovered Parts</h2>
<p>Continuing the comparison between containers and templates, it&rsquo;s worth noting
that templates can offer a more comprehensive initial setup. This might
include project layout, deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, VCS hooks,
monitoring dashboards, alerts, and other elements. It&rsquo;s important to understand
that templates provide these features only at the initial project creation and
do not enforce them during subsequent project evolution (whereas containers
maintain consistency).</p>
<p>In conclusion good to know that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive
and this article aims to explore the available options.</p>
